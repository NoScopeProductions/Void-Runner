Void Runner is an endless runner game targeted at Windows Phone 8, Android, and iOS devices. The player controls a ship which is attempting to escape from a destroyed space station through an tunnel that is being bombarded with asteroids. The player must collect pick-ups which increase fuel, activate shields, or provide a speed boost to aid the player in escaping further through the tunnel.
